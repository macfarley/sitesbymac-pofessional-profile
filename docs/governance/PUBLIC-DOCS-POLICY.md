# Public Documentation Policy

## Purpose

This policy defines what documentation is safe and appropriate to keep in the public repository.

## Public (Tracked) Documentation

Public docs should:

- Explain architecture, setup, and usage at a high level.
- Link to files that exist in the repository and are intended for public visibility.
- Avoid internal-only process notes, sensitive operations details, or private business methods.

## Private (Untracked) Documentation

Private docs may include:

- Internal process notes and experiments.
- Drafts, private operating methods, and unpublished strategy.
- Personal planning artifacts.

Private docs should not be referenced directly by file path from public docs.

## Access to Private Methods

Readers can request additional internal documentation details by contacting:

- **mac@sitesbymac.dev**
