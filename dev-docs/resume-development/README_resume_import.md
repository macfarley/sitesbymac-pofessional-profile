README — Resume import from Copilot share

Source: https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/R4ycMsz2iew1wrsnfHKsS

What I tried:
- I attempted to fetch the Copilot share URL to automatically read the conversation and extract resume data.
- The fetch returned no transcript content. This is usually because the share requires sign-in or is private.

How you can help me complete the resume import:
1. Paste the full conversation transcript into `resume_from_copilot.md` below the template, or paste it into a reply here.
2. Or export the conversation to a plain-text file and add it to the repo (e.g., `copilot_conversation.txt`).
3. If you prefer, provide a short summary: your name, contact info, a list of roles/projects with dates and 2–3 achievements each.

Next steps I'll take after you provide the content:
- Parse the conversation and extract structured resume items (roles, companies, dates, projects, tech, accomplishments).
- Draft a polished, ATS-friendly resume in `resume_from_copilot.md` and offer a concise LinkedIn summary.
- Ask follow-up clarifying questions for any missing dates or metrics.

If you'd like, I can also proactively draft a resume now using reasonable assumptions and placeholders — tell me whether you'd prefer that or want me to wait for the pasted transcript.
