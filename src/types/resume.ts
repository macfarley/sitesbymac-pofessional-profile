/**
 * Resume Type Definitions for Sites by Mac Portfolio
 * 
 * This file contains TypeScript interfaces for all resume-related data structures.
 * These types power the PDF generation, resume display components, and data validation
 * throughout the application.
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Comprehensive coverage of resume sections
 * - Optional fields for flexibility
 * - Structured data for easy manipulation
 * - ATS-friendly field naming
 * 
 * Usage: Import these types in components that display or process resume data

/**
 * Education Interface
 * 
 * Represents educational background including formal degrees, bootcamps,
 * certifications programs, and relevant coursework.
 * 
 * Cool Usage Patterns:
 * - Sort by graduation date: education.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.graduationDate) - new Date(a.graduationDate))
 * - Filter by degree level: education.filter(e => e.degree.includes('Bachelor'))
 * - Group by institution: education.reduce((acc, e) => { ... }, {})

/**
 * ==========================================
 * TYPE USAGE PATTERNS & COOL TECHNIQUES
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * 1. Type Guards for Runtime Validation:
 *    function isValidEducation(obj: any): obj is Education {
 *      return obj && typeof obj.institution === 'string' && typeof obj.degree === 'string'
 *    }
 * 
 * 2. Partial Types for Form Editing:
 *    type EducationForm = Partial<Education> & { institution: string; degree: string }
 * 
 * 3. Omit Types for API Responses:
 *    type PublicPersonalInfo = Omit<PersonalInfo, 'phone' | 'email'>
 * 
 * 4. Union Types for Status Fields:
 *    type MembershipStatus = 'Active' | 'Alumni' | 'Officer' | 'Board Member'
 * 
 * 5. Array Type Utilities:
 *    type SkillCategory = Skill['category']  // Extract just the category type
 *    type AllSkills = Skill['skills'][number]  // Extract individual skill type
 * 
 * 6. Date Validation Patterns:
 *    const isValidDate = (date: string): boolean => !isNaN(Date.parse(date))
 * 
 * 7. Resume Data Validation:
 *    const validateResume = (data: unknown): data is { personalInfo: PersonalInfo, ... } => { ... }
 * 
 * 8. Type-Safe Data Fetching:
 *    const fetchEducation = async (): Promise<Education[]> => { ... }
