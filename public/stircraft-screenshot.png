## StirCraft Screenshot Placeholder

This file represents the StirCraft homepage screenshot that should be saved here.

The actual image should show:
- The elegant StirCraft homepage with brown/cream color scheme
- The "Welcome to StirCraft" heading
- The cocktail glass logo with script typography
- The "Browse Cocktails" and "Log in" buttons
- The description: "Discover, create, and share cocktail recipes crafted by a passionate community"

Since I cannot directly save binary image files, you'll need to:
1. Right-click on the StirCraft screenshot you shared
2. Save it as "stircraft-screenshot.png" in this public folder
3. Replace this placeholder file

The image looks professional and perfectly showcases the sophisticated design mentioned in your README!
